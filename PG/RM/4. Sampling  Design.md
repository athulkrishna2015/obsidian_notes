# 1 CENSUS AND SAMPLE SURVEY
- All items in any field of inquiry constitute a ‘Universe’ or ‘Population.’
- Perhaps, government is the only institution which can get the complete enumeration carried out
- The selected respondents constitute what is technically called a ‘sample’
# 2 STEPS IN SAMPLE DESIGN
## 2.1 Type of universe:
- clearly define the set of objects, technically called the Universe, to be studied. The universe can be **finite or infinite**.
## 2.2 Sampling unit:
- Sampling unit may be a geographical one such as state, district, village, etc ,Social
## 2.3 Source list:
- It is also known as ‘sampling frame’
- from which sample is to be drawn.
- contains the names of all items of a universe (in case of finite universe only)
## 2.4 Size of sample:
- number of items to be selected from the universe to constitute a sample.
- larger variance usually a bigger sample is needed
- Costs too dictate the size of sample
## 2.5 Parameters of interest:
- one must consider the question of the specific population parameters which are of interest.
## 2.6 Budgetary constraint:
- from practical point of view
## 2.7 Sampling procedure:
- design which, for a given sample size and for a given cost, has a smaller sampling error.
# 3 CRITERIA OF SELECTING A SAMPLING PROCEDURE
- the cost of collecting the data and the cost of an incorrect inference resulting from the data. Researcher must keep in view the two causes of incorrect inferences viz., **systematic bias and sampling error**.
## 3.1 systematic bias 
- results from errors in the sampling procedures
- It cannot be reduced or eliminated by increasing the sample size.
### 3.1.1 Inappropriate sampling frame:
### 3.1.2 Defective measuring device:
### 3.1.3 Non-respondents:
### 3.1.4 Indeterminancy principle: 
-individuals act differently when kept under observation than what they do when kept in non-observed situations.
### 3.1.5 Natural bias in the reporting of data:
- Generally in psychological surveys, people tend to give what they think is the ‘correct’ answer rather than revealing their true feelings.
## 3.2 Sampling errors
- random variations in the sample estimates around the true population parameters
- Sampling error decreases with the increase in the size of the sample, and it happens to be of a  smaller magnitude in case of homogeneous population
- measurement of sampling error is usually called the **‘precision of the sampling plan’.**
	- increase the sample size, the precision can be improved.
	- large sized sample increases the cost of collecting data and also enhances the systematic bias.
	- effective way to increase precision is usually to select a better sampling design
# 4 CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD SAMPLE DESIGN
1. truly representative
2. small sampling error
3. viable in the context of funds
4. systematic bias can be controlled in a better way.
# 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF SAMPLE DESIGNS

## 5.1 Probability sampling
- Based on the consept of random selection random sampling’ or ‘chance sampling’
- every item of the universe has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample.
- blind chance alone that determines whether one item or the other is selected.
- Random sampling ensures the **law of Statistical Regularity** which states that if on an average the sample chosen is a random one, the sample will have the samecomposition and characteristics as the universe.
- $^NC_n$ possible samples has the same probability, $\frac{1}{^NC_n}$ , of being selected
## 5.2 Non Probability sampling
- based on the consepts of non random selection
- Non-probability sampling is also known by different names such as deliberate sampling, purposive sampling and judgement sampling.
- personal element has a great chance of entering into the selection of the sample.
- Sampling error in this type of sampling cannot be estimated and the element of bias, great or small, is always there.
### 5.2.1 Quota sampling
- actual selection of the items for the sample is left to the interviewer’s discretion.
- Quota samples are essentially judgement samples
