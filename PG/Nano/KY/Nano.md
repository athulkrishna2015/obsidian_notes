**Nanoscience** is the study of phenomena and manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular and macromolecular scales,

Nanotechnologies are the design, characterization, production and application of structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at nanometre scale.

**Historical Example**![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_dbb3d552dfdea93a.png)

The “Lycurgus Cup” is a Roman artifact from before 640 AD.

It appears green in reflected light, but appears red when light is shone from inside, and is transmitted through the glass

This effect is caused by gold and silver nanoparticles ( ~70 nm) in 1:14,

The color of gold changes as the particle size changes at the nanometer scale

  

**Red Gold!!!**

**Why are Nanomaterials so Special?**

Role of surface effects increases with decreasing dimensions

The properties of materials can be different at the Nanoscale for two main reasons:

1.  First, Nanomaterials have a relatively larger surface area when compared to the same mass of material produced in a larger form. Nano particles can make materials more chemically reactive and affect their strength or electrical properties.
    
2.  Second, quantum effects can begin to dominate the behaviour of matter at the Nanoscale.
    

  

**Quantum Size Effects in Nanostructured Material**

In bulk material, of micron size, the electrons of the constituent atoms can move freely in side the material. When size is reduced to nano meter range, the electrons are confined to a small space, which causes quantization in their allowed energy states. Kubo Gap

  

![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_994ed61ed9584329.png) ![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_5ef534f97f20f267.png)  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

In bulk material the mean free path or de-Broglie wave length of an electron is much smaller than the sample dimensions. When anyone, two or all three dimensions of material become comparable to the mean free path of carriers, quantum size effects not only become apparent and but also dominate the electronic and optical properties of the materials.

**Applications**

  

-   The leaves of the Lotus plant have the outstanding characteristic of totally repelling water because they are superhydrophobic
    

Detailed SEM analysis of leaves that display the Lotus-effect has revealed the presence of wax nanocrystals on the leaf surface.

When you splash the Lotus leaf with water, water rolls off the leaf, and in doing so drags dirt away.

The ![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_de010e2f0f8ac79e.png) result is that the Lotus leaf is dry and clean. This effect, called “self-cleaning”

Contaminants on the surface rest on the tips of the rough surface. When a water droplet rolls over the contaminant, the droplet removes the particle from the surface of the leaf.

even in a swampy area lous leaves stay dry and clean

  

**Hydrophobic vs. Hydrophilic**

  

**hydro****phobic**:

-   “fear of water”
    
-   Refers to the degree that water “beads up” on a surface
    
-   Hydrophobic: 0 > 90°
    
-   Superhydrophobic: 0 > 150°
    

  

**hydrophilic:**

-   “love of water”
    
-   Refers to the degree that water “wets” or adheres to a surface
    
-   Hydrophilic: 0 < 90°
    

  

  

**Contact Angle**

Angle where water drop makes contact with the surfaceThe large contact angle results from nanoscopic bumps that trap air between the water and the surface minimizing the contact with the surface. A drop of water rolls downwards on leaf surface, picking up dirt. ![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_b276df13cfb434e6.png)

-   The fibres of the textile contain a large number of very small “pins”, or “whiskers” on their surface. Therefore the fabric does not contain a surface coating (which could be removed by washing, or sweating). ![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_6e42d1260aacca48.png)

**Rose Petal Effect:  A Superhydrophobic State with High Adhesive Force**

![](file:///tmp/lu221516q09xk1.tmp/lu221516q09xky_tmp_f656865957cf584e.png)  

Rose is able to hold on to water droplets even when upside down. The finding could lead to new adhesive materials.

  

Hierarchical micropapillae and nanofolds are known to exist on the petals' surfaces of red roses. These micro- and nanostructures provide a sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity and yet at the same time a high adhesive force with water. A water droplet on the surface of the petal appears spherical in shape, which cannot roll off even when the petal is turned upside down. We define this phenomenon as the “**petal effect**” as compared with the popular “**lotus effect”**

**Geko- Effect**

Geko-Family name for lizard. Geko effect or crawling of a lizard on wall. How does a lizard balance its weight? The peculiar construction of the tips of its feet on which millions of nano hair exist which help lizard in crawling. Interestingly the force that each hair strand exerts between wall and itself is just weak Van der Waals force. However, due to millions of hairs total force is sufficient to balance its weight and remove the force in controlled way to crawl. This effect may be useful to make robots which would climb the walls.

**Honda and Fujishima Effect**

  

-   In 1972, Fujishima and Honda ﬁrst showed direct water splitting using (photoanode), using a PEC Cell (at 840 mV bias)
    
-   Since then, a large number of semiconductor materials have been investigated for PEC electrodes for production
    
-   Metal oxides, with wide bandgap (2.5—3.5 eV) are polpular

**is an effective photocatalyst**

  

-   When TiOz irradiated with UV light- electrons and holes are generated.
    
-   Photogenerated electrons reduce water to form H2 on a Pt counter electrode
    
-   Holes oxidize water to form 02 on the TiOz electrode (with some external bias by a power supply)
    

  

**Hydrogen Energy**

  

-   Hydrogen is the simplest and the most plentiful element in the universe.
    
-   'It's always elements. Combinedwith other
    
-   'Hydrogen is high in energy, yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution.
    
-   ' NASA has used liquid hydrogen since the 1970s to propel the space shuttle and other rockets into orbit
    
-   The hydrogen economy could be an alternative to our current on and coal based economy.
    

  

**Problems associated with Hydrogen Safety Hazards**

  

-   Hydrogen is highly ﬂammable and combustible
    
-   Hydrogen leakage may cause explosions
    
-   Pure hydrogen is poisonous
    
-   Hydrogen can cause many metals to become brittle, posing a problem to the design of pipelines and storage tanks.
