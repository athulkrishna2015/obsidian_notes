# Synthesis of nano materials
## Top-down approach
- slicing or successive cutting of a bulk material to get nano sized particle
- Starting material is solid
### Mechanical methods
-  cutting, etching, grinding, ballmilling
### lithographic techniques
- photo lithography 
- electrobeam lithography
---
## Bottom up approach
- Atom by atom deposition leads to formation of Self- assembly of atoms/molecules and clusters 
- Starting material is liquid or gas
### Physcical 
#### Physical Vapour Deposition
##### Inert Gas condensation (IGC)

- Evoparation of metalic souce in inert gas
- metal is evoporated in ultra high vaccum (UHV) 
- Vapour collide with inert gas thus loosing the kinetic energy
- at super saturation metals condenced on nitrogen cooled surfaces
---
- evoporation, Suputtering, Plasma arching, Laser ablation
### Chemical
#### CVD
- Deposition of vapour phase reaction species
	-  PVCVD  
#### Self  Assembled monolayer
- Electrolitic deposition
- solgel method
- Microemulsion route
- Pyrolysis
## Growth Kinetics (Cluster Formation followed by Nucleation and Growth)
